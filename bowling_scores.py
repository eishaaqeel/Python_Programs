# Title:    bowling_scores
# Author:   Eisha Aqeel
# Date:     November 26, 2021.
# Description:
#   The application should display the original bowling scores, followed by
# the player average, high score, and low score. It should also ask if the
# user would like to do another round each time the program's about to end.
# The purpose of this is to learn about Arrays.
